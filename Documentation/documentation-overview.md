# This is the Big One

- Document the process for building
- Show the logic that went into it
- Show what the problems are and the solution
- Show issues with the current design with potential solutions
- Have examples for the solutions/alternatives, even if not applied to this application
- Future dev  

Have a GitHub wiki if that makes sense (a README would get too big)

## Where It's At, What Needs to Be Done

Currently have the main branch and a feature branch that started designing a grid look for the astronomy thumbnail component.
There's more that needs to be done, I would need to have the breakpoints stuff decoupled and reusable first.  
So, I'm not going to go there yet.
I want to wrap this up to this point:

- I can present it at any time
- The main project is not dependent on a feature branch under development  

This is where I'm at right now, minus:

- Documentation/Wiki
- Public Respository
- ~~Built/Deployed (would have to deploy to Node, definitely not necessary. In fact, probably just avoid until it can be done in C#)~~

### After the Main Is Complete, What Comes Next

- Turn the repetitive code into loosely coupled code (this is first, should be done right after the above )
- Material Breakpoints as a Library, or at the very least loosely-coupled and available to be used in a project inside or outside
  - If library, implement library in this project
    - I will develop the library with a branch of this.
- After part 1, then can replace Astronomy-Pics Thumbnail with the grid layout using the responsive service  

## To Do List

- [ ] Go through all notes on the project
- [ ] Re-write and edit as documentation/wiki pages
- [ ] Create public Github Repo
- [ ] Push to the repo
- [ ] Start the wiki
- [ ] finish the wiki
