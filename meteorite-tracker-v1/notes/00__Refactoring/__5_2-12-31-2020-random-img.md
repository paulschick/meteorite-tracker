1. Finish up the functionality for the component
2. Style for Dark Mode  

Then I'll be moving onto the dark/light modes toggle functionality.

- Added initial styling and scss file/folder structure to random-image module components
- Removed global margin introduced through the sidenav component. Updated all component layouts to fit  

Okay so I got this working.
The number of columns is set in the HTML, how do I set this with a media query?  

[Here is a stack overflow question addressing this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48493652/angular-5-mat-grid-list-responsive)  

- Angular Material docs: `BreakpointObserver` is a way to evaluate media queries and react to the changes
  - So this is the provided solution for media queries in a component  

1. Create an interface for the grids based on breakpoint:

```ts
export interface IResponsiveGridColumns {
  xs?: number;
  sm?: number;
  md?: number;
  lg?: number;
  xl?: number;
}
```

One of the solutions is to create a directive.
While I can just copy this and it will probably mostly work, at least, I want to understand what's going on with these solutions.  

Heres why: the reason that I had to go back and redo all of the layout margins was because I just copied the styling for the sidenav originally.
I had set a margin on that, and this component houses all of the components, and this affected everything downstream.
So I want to be sure of exactly what the solution is going to do at each line of code.  

In the directive in the class, a private variable is set which has the type of the column interface

```ts
export class Example {

  private countBySize: IResponsiveGridColumns = { xs:2, sm:2, md:4, lg:4, xl:6 };

}
```

he then uses a getter and a setter.
The getter, gets this Object that was just instantiated as a private variable.
The setter implements some directive-specific stuff that I don't really know what it's doing.  

It takes in the interface as a 'map' argument, and runs a conditional.
The conditional makes sure that we passed in an argument, and then checks to see that the argument is an Object.
If these are both true, it sets `this.countBySize` to be equal to `map`.  

All-in-all the getter and the setter look at the private variable and return it, check to make sure it is the correct type, and then set the private variable as the map for the Directive.  

that looks like this:

```ts
export class Example {

  private countBySize: IResponsiveGridColumns = { xs:2, sm:2, md:4, lg:4, xl:6 };

  // getter
  public get cols(): IResponsiveGridColumns {
    return this.countBySize;
  }

  // Setter -> takes in 'responsiveCols', which is the selector for the Directive
  @Input('responsiveCols')
  public set cols(map: IResponsiveGridColumns) {
    if (map && ('object' === (typeof map))) {
      this.countBySize = map;
    }
  }

}
```

Keep in mind the usage of this.
This is used on a `mat-grid-list` element in the template.
It will take in the `countBySize` variable through property binding.
Thus, these values will be set in the template.
This makes the selector, `[responsiveCols]` make more sense.
Here's how that would look in the HTML template:

```html
<mat-grid-list [responsiveCols]="{ xs:2, sm:2, md:4, lg:4, xl:6 }"></mat-grid-list>
```

Next we get to the constructor method.
This will instantiate a private variable of `grid` set to the type of `MatGridList`, which comes from Material Module.
Then instantiate a private `media` variable set to type `ObservableMedia`.
`ObservableMedia` and `MediaChange` are imports from angular/flex-layout.
Looks Like I need to reinstall that!

[Here's the repo](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout)  
Branching before install, merging after import and it works.

```ps1
# Install from npm and save
npm i -s @angular/flex-layout @angular/cdk
# Probably already have angular cdk
```

I am going to import this into core module.

```ts
import { FlexLayoutModule } from '@angular/flex-layout';
//
//
@NgModule({
  //
  imports: [ FlexLayoutModule ],
});
```

Now I will be able to use those two dependencies in the Directive.
Even if I go another route, looks like I need this either way.  

The constructor will call a method `initializeColsCount()`.
Here are some things in this method:

- `.some()` -> checks whether at least one element in an array passes the test in the function
- `Object.keys()` -> returns an array of a given object's own *enumerable* property names. Iterated in the same order that a normal loop would.
  - So if you have `{ a: 'string1', b: 'string2', c:42 }`, the output of `Object.keys(object1)` would be `['a','b','c']`
  - In other words, it gives you an array of keys  

This method calls `.keys` on the countBySize object, and so would return the grid keys like xs, sm, and so on.
Then it calls .some on this, to check if there is at least one key that matches `media.isActive(mqAlias)`.

- media comes from flex-layout, as does isActive.
- You can see this in the repository for Angular Flex Layout.  

Two APIs on `MediaObserver` injectable:

- media -> `Observable<MediaChange>`
- isActive -> boolean  

This uses the Breakpoint Registry to monitory the screen size and then inject this information.
So that allows you to have custom media query code.
Things like sm, xs, etc. are aliases associated with the mediaQuery for mobile viewport sizes.  

You can use this stuff in an `*ngIf` to only show if something is active.
I could actually use this logic as well, as opposed to creating a directive:

```html
<div class="content" *ngIf="mediaObserver.isActive('xs')">
  This only shows on mobile viewport sizes
</div>
```

To use this, `MediaObserver` is injected into the constructor of the component whos template this is in, and in the component you call a method if the active viewport is mobile.
This method is typically named `loadMobileContent()`.  

You need to pass in the media query to the mediaObserver isActive  

```ts
const PRINT_MOBILE = 'print and (max-width: 600px)';
!this.mediaObserver.isActive(PRINT_MOBILE)
```

So this is evaluating for the condition where the active media query is not a max-width of 600px.
That specific query is a mediaQuery for printing with mobile viewport sizes.  

## My Implementation

I really only need a few conditions.
I'm not going to set grids for every viewport size.
Two sizes: medium and down, above medium.  

[Here's another resource using a directive](https://www.mymiller.name/wordpress/programming/angular-material-grid-layout-responsive/)  

### Main Points

- In order to keep the logic outside of the component, I'll need to create a directive
- I will use an interface for matching the breakpoint alias to the number of grid columns  

Here's the code from there, which I am going to modify:

1. Separate interface
2. switch statement instead of chained `if`s.

```ts
import {Directive, Input, OnDestroy, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import { MatGridList } from '@angular/material';
import { BreakpointObserver, Breakpoints } from '@angular/cdk/layout';

// Create separate interface model
export interface GridColumns {
  xs: number;
  sm: number;
  md: number;
  lg: number;
  xl: number;
}

// reference this through property binding with [gridCols]
@Directive({
  selector: '[gridCols]'
})
export class GridColsDirective implements OnInit {
  // set # columns wanted for each viewport size
  private gridCols: GridColumns = {xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 4, lg: 6, xl: 8};

  public get cols(): GridColumns {
    // get the object specified
    return this.gridCols;
  }

  @Input('gridCols')
  // take in gridCols as an input variable
  public set cols(map: GridColumns) {
    // check that the object is the right type
    if (map && ('object' === (typeof map))) {
      this.gridCols = map;
    }
  }

  public constructor(private grid: MatGridList, private breakpointObserver: BreakpointObserver) {
    // this.grid !== null means that there is a grid-list being used
    if(this.grid != null) {
      // if there is, then set the column number on the element
      // this is like automatically setting it to the medium column number
      // so medium is the default then if not specified
      this.grid.cols = this.gridCols.md;
    }
  }

  public ngOnInit(): void {
    if(this.grid != null) {
      this.grid.cols = this.gridCols.md;
    }
    this.breakpointObserver.observe([

      // using breakpoint observer, not angular/flex-layout here
      Breakpoints.XSmall,
      Breakpoints.Small,
      Breakpoints.Medium,
      Breakpoints.Large,
      Breakpoints.XLarge
    ]).subscribe(result => {

      if (result.breakpoints[Breakpoints.XSmall]) {
        this.grid.cols = this.gridCols.xs;
      }
      if (result.breakpoints[Breakpoints.Small]) {
        this.grid.cols = this.gridCols.sm;
      }
      if (result.breakpoints[Breakpoints.Medium]) {
        this.grid.cols = this.gridCols.md;
      }
      if (result.breakpoints[Breakpoints.Large]) {
        this.grid.cols = this.gridCols.lg;
      }
      if (result.breakpoints[Breakpoints.XLarge]) {
        this.grid.cols = this.gridCols.xl;
      }
    });
  }
}
```

Actually for one breakpoint, going back to the stackoverflow answers, I can use ngOnInit and onResize event to do this.  

But, to have something reusable, you want to create a directive.
Then I can add this to the library, rather than just in one component.
I'm going to go the directive and separate interface route.  

Keep in mind, the reason that xs, sm, md, etc. work here is that they are registered in angular flex-layout.
So these aliases have media queries associated with them.
For example, `xs` is tied to the query `screen and (max-width: 599px)`.  

So we can pass this into the isActive, which will know how to evaluate that.  

[ObservableMedia Documentation](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/blob/master/docs/documentation/ObservableMedia.md)  
[and the stackoverflow to have it right here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48493652/angular-5-mat-grid-list-responsive)  

- Provides mediaQuery activations notifications for registered Breakpoints
- this is an Observable that allows you to subscribe to mediaQuery changes, and you validate with `isActive()` to check to see if an alias is active
- The Observable is of type `<MediaChange>`.  

So I'll keep reading the docs.
The next question is, if I'm using a directive, how is that used with the component?

### Issue

So this is all for an older version of Angular.
The same imports don't seem to exist now, so I do need to have a custom solution anyhow.

I want to do something like:

```html
<mat-grid-list [cols]="getCols()">
  <mat-grid-tile *ngFor="let x of astronomyImgArr">
    <img src="{{ x.url }}" alt="{{ x.copyright }}" />
    ></mat-grid-tile
  >
</mat-grid-list>
```

and then have the `getCols()` method return the number of columns that are wanted.
So that's really all that it should have to be.

## Possible Depracation

So flex-layout like, hasn't really been updated too much recently.
The methods in the docs are deprecated.
It's kind of been a nightmare to figure out, so I'm looking for an alternative just using, like css.  

I mean there's definitely a way that Angular has built in to watch for changes in the breakPoint, and I can just use this to assign classes or values.

- `ngAfterViewInit()`  

[Also this is a pretty good guide](https://cloudengineering.studio/articles/combine-power-angular-services-directives-to-detect-screen-size-changes)  
[Here's the Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/yokoishioka/8eabe6c92e850e0efbefdcf207a4ef95)  

- `@HostLitener()` decorator that declares a DOM event to listen for, and provides a handler method to run when that event occurs.  

So I can create a directive using this.
The goal will be to return a value based on the screen size.
This doesn't need to directly match with `BreakpointObserver`, but the component can evaluate the values returned by the directive, and then compare those with `BreakpointObserver`.
The reason for that is for even more (potentially) reusability, so that it doesn't need to be used with the exact method that the component is using it for.  

The solution presented here uses a Directive, Service, and Component.  

**Directive**: Listens for when the screen width changes and sends those values to the service.  
**Service**: Receives values from anyone who uses it, categorizes the number by screen size (if requested) and sends values to whoever subscribes to them.  
**Component**: Tells the directive when to start listening for changes. Subscribes to the service to get back the values, specifying it only cares when the values change.
Determines when to stop sending values.

I guess instead of using the mat-grid-list, I could also just use css grid...  

This is like the standard css solution instead of watching through Angular for the screen to change.
Media Queries work here too.  

Maybe I am just going to complex here.  

It really seems like any solution, like programatically assigning a class, is still dependent on knowing the size of the screen.  

Or just have the mat-list items going, and wrap it in a parent component which has a SCSS media query on it.
If I use CSS grid, I can just have the grid layout of the parent change based on the media query.
I mean that could work too.

Then I just wouldn't use Material Grid List.

## CSS Grid

So, this ended up being a lot simpler than I was making it with the directive.  

Here's the thing though.
This does work.
But, I really think that the mat-grid-list looked a lot better than how the CSS grid is working.
I could put in a bunch of media queries to deal with this, but I'm not considering this solved.  

This is a band-aid, but I still want to programatically apply the cols number based on the screen size.
It's what it is.
