## Bug Just Found

So the picture of the day, today apparently is a youtube video.
I should perform a check that the returned response is a .jpg extension, else go to another one.  

Anyway, leave it for now, move into cleanup, linting, testing.

- Deleted styles.scss from src, as well as references to it in angular.json
- Commented out unused modules in shared.module.ts  

I am not using `FlexLayoutModule`, remove that from package.json

- removed from packages and from dependencies with:

```ps1
npm uninstall @angular/flex-layout --save
```

At this point, I may even be able to move everything from the shared module into the core module.
There is very little in there.
But, for scaling, if one is to add to this app, it would be nice to have the structure as it is.  

Nothin really wrong with it being ready for more.

- removed unused global scss partials in shared/scss folder

- Removed comments and dead space in all code
