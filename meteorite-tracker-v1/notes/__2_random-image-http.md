# Getting Multiple Random Images

This new branch is going to be a clean slate on these components.
I spent the time to get the grid columns, and that works great.
Now I need the template to display a unique, random image each time the button is pressed.
The way that this is to be done is different from the original intended function of the code that I looked at.  

**Rule Out** the caching. This isn't the problem.
This is all components and services here.
Might need to do another service, which is fine, and maybe another directive to handle this.
Could result in more reusable code, which is great.
