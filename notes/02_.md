# Section 02

Goals Here:

- connect the meteorite service
- create meteorite interface in model
- Get a click event going on -> change styles, something fun.  

NOTES:  

For dependency injection... Injectable decorator goes on the service.
No decorator needed in the component, just:

- import and add to AppModule provider
- import to component
- pass into component's constructor func. to initialize the service
- use ngOnInit to call the service on component load
