## Cleanup and Home Component

So, the meteorite stuff is all together. In implementing a home component, I will need to have routing in this.
So, go back to the Pluralsight routing thing.
Then, I might have to have interceptors.  

## APD

Created folder APD (astronomy picture of the day).
For the model, there is quite a bit of information. I think I'll start with that.  

So, I think that the APD component should just serve the image from the API.
Then it can be put anywhere. I can have the home page and whatever separate.  

So right now, I just have the selector inserted in the app component. This is going to be removed, and will be implementing routing.
I want to get the service and content hooked up and served first.

## 001 apd

new git branch for the service.
