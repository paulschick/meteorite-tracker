# 12/30/2020 Refactoring

Did two things:

- Added show/hide to meteorite display component.  

Started with `*ngIf`, but this had some problems:

- Had to make an API request everytime it toggled from hide/show (or request to cache)
- If you pressed 'Recent' before hiding, it wouldn't show again until you hit ALL because the component couldn't get .slice() of undefined  

So I changed this to hidden css property.
All around much faster and no problems.  

This is where unit testing that function would be great.  

Next, removed the BreakPoint Observer stuff from the SideNav.
Added the ability to close the sidenav just by clicking outside of it.  

Next, for better UX:

- I'm going to need the Astronomy Pics API to come through a route resolver.
  - The page just doesn't look good when the Heading is showing and the images aren't loaded yet.

## New Branch 01-route-resolver-astro-pics

Implementing a route resolver for astronomy-pics page (gallery view)  

- Implemented route resolver
- removed homeService from meteorite-list, removed astroPicsService from astronomy-pics list component (not needed with resolver in place)

### Next Up

I could do more to improve the safety and function of the application.

- Implement more models/interfaces (objects, functions)
- Implement testing to components, services, routes, modules  

Testing is big, and for the most part will show where weaknesses are.  

More features to improve UX

- have an instance of a description preview for astronomy pics, create a pipe that reduces the size of the string containing the explanation
- Have the generate random image component -> this would implement the explanation preview and custom pipe
- Generate tests for the pipe (they're at least the easiest to test)  

### To-Do Outside of This Project

In consideration of making an Angular library of reusable code, I could get started with a Custom Pipes Library.
This would include custom pipes that can be reused, like the mass conversion pipe, along with tests for these pipes.  

Something like the mass-conversion pipe could actually be turned into an npm package.
That would be pretty cool to publish.  

Have the source code open source on Github, and then publish it as an npm package.
Now again, with this project being closed-source as it is, I am going to make a copy in a public repository.
Before I do so, I'd remove the notes and extra files, and I need to hide the config file, have it added to the .gitignore file.  

Not a huge deal, but my API key shouldn't be exposed (even though they're free, and you can get one very easily).  

Or, to make this project public, change the names of the folders/files containing stuff that I want to hide and just add the new names to the .gitignore.

## take() operator

`take(1)` will make the HTTP call one time, and return the result.
This is a way to, essentially unsubscribe and help with memory leaks.
I implemented this in all of my services.

## Random Image Module

Although there are probably better file structures, I am going to continue to follow my convention.
I created this module for the view for generating random image.

- Lazy load, new view, share with astro-pic service, same as home page.  

For this, I would like to demonstrate the use of an Event Emitter, and emit a click event or something else.

- Module, page components, routing module, lazy loading, all set up and route is working.
- Next step add to the sidenav  

One thing about the sidenav, and you see this on the new page with no content, as well as a page that is still loading, the page doesn't take up the whole screen.
So the sidenav is only really loading on half of the screen, so I need to set like height 100% on the sidenav.

- Added 100vh to scss for `_layout` for random-image page
- Fixed it on load, will probably need to change this with dev.
