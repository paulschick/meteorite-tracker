# 12/30/2020 Refactoring

Did two things:

- Added show/hide to meteorite display component.  

Started with `*ngIf`, but this had some problems:

- Had to make an API request everytime it toggled from hide/show (or request to cache)
- If you pressed 'Recent' before hiding, it wouldn't show again until you hit ALL because the component couldn't get .slice() of undefined  

So I changed this to hidden css property.
All around much faster and no problems.  

This is where unit testing that function would be great.  

Next, removed the BreakPoint Observer stuff from the SideNav.
Added the ability to close the sidenav just by clicking outside of it.  

Next, for better UX:

- I'm going to need the Astronomy Pics API to come through a route resolver.
  - The page just doesn't look good when the Heading is showing and the images aren't loaded yet.

## New Branch 01-route-resolver-astro-pics

Implementing a route resolver for astronomy-pics page (gallery view)  

- Implemented route resolver
- removed homeService from meteorite-list, removed astroPicsService from astronomy-pics list component (not needed with resolver in place)
