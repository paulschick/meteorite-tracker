# Random Image Functionality

1. Finish up the functionality for the component
2. Style for Dark Mode  

Then I'll be moving onto the dark/light modes toggle functionality.

- Added initial styling and scss file/folder structure to random-image module components
- Removed global margin introduced through the sidenav component. Updated all component layouts to fit  

Okay so I got this working.
The number of columns is set in the HTML, how do I set this with a media query?  

[Here is a stack overflow question addressing this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48493652/angular-5-mat-grid-list-responsive)  

- Angular Material docs: `BreakpointObserver` is a way to evaluate media queries and react to the changes
  - So this is the provided solution for media queries in a component
