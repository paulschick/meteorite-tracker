# Moving Forward

I'd like to have something nice for a demonstration. Here are some topics that will be covered that should be included insofar as they can be and it makes sense:

- Securing Angular Apps with OpenID Connect
- RxJS (more stuff)
- Angular Material (currently Boostrap, perhaps do this in another application)  

Alternatively, maybe I have a few more views with this, add in routing, and add in sorting and filtering.  

So, if you filter the page, would this go to a filtered view? Or just modify the page?  

It might be worth just making a detail page, and I could also have comments. Hard-coded, and allow you to just add some.
