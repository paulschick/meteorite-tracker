# Building Out the Nasa API

We can get this to go further. In fact, Nasa has some pretty awesome endpoints, like the Astronomy Picture of the Day.
That would make a great cover image for the website.  

Additionally, these endpoints have custom API parameters, so I can really apply some of the Http request stuff that I've been learning.  

I signed up with my personal email.  

API Key:  
wj7jAdpeOnwUhXeUR40W9Ll02P7hiJ2N0j5Rv0uY  

Pass in the key to the url to make a request, like this:  
<https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=wj7jAdpeOnwUhXeUR40W9Ll02P7hiJ2N0j5Rv0uY>  

And this looks like the picture of the day.  
Anyone can register for one of these keys, and now they have my info :)
