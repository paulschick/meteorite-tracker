## Branch Name: 12-28-2020-style

Still working through home page.
Converting reusable styling patterns to mixins & variables.  

Meteorite List -> Filter Meteorites div

- Style the Heading 'Meteorite List'
- Considering removing the colored div
- Style the Buttons  

Sidenav

- Try centering and spacing these, see how they look
- I think there is too much difference between the nav-buttons here, no need for them to be very distinct
- Two standard link buttons, same size and color could be fine, I don't know that I like the accent color here either.
- Maybe just like a lighter version of the Primary color, or match the dark shade which I do like  

After this, I think if the Astronomy Picture for the current day is to be featured on the home page, it too should click through to a detail page.
Especially because the current design of the application means that you can't read the details on today's astronomy picture until the following day.

## Style Like Painting - Finish a Room

I'm going to finish the sidenav, since it appears open on a large screen.
That's what it's going to mostly be viewed on, and since the top of the Home Page looks good, this is really a big part of the first impression.

## Sidenav

1. Move current scss to partials and import  

Get the structure right. BEM naming system is already in place.

### Buttons

- Responds to hover -> just a color change, some feedback on interaction with the button
- Then just color, that's it.
  - Go with dark shade first
  - Any hover color should be very subtle, not like the way that the meteorite divs currently are.  

Button styling is sufficient for now.
Using almost entirely mixins and variables.
I like having like a full btn-dark mixin and for the hover as well.

## Meteorite Stuff

Now what I the filtering buttons also make the list go from hidden by default to showing?
That could be interesting.
Just need to add a property and the ngIf deal that happens when it changes.  

Let's get some more styling first.

### Required Feature

This is a simple feature that will really improve UX:  
Add a button in the sidenav that also closes it

- Currently, you have to scroll to the top of the page to close the sidenav :frowning:

### Meteorite List Heading

Got the heading styled, as well as the div with the filtering buttons.  

**Note on importing global styles to components**: You do not need to import the global stylesheet to every partial scss file.
Import it once to the main component stylesheet and the variables/mixins can be used in all of the partials.
