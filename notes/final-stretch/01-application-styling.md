## Initial Todos

There is a definite need for refactoring in the Home Module.
Priority right now is styling, and proper scss scaffolding.
This is where I'll start.  

### Styling Components

1. Home Page
2. Astronomy Pics Page
3. Astronomy Pic Detail Page  

That's all the views that exist.
Then, will refactor Home Module.
When this is done, need to make some kind of footer component and style that as well.
After this is all absolutely solid, I can make an about page or some informational content with author information.  

When it's ready to publish:

1. Create new public repo
2. Have API config in .gitignore and make sure it isn't pushed to Github
3. Build for production and push to Heroku
