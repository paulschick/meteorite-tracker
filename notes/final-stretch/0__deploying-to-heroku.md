# Deploy Angular 10 to Heroku

So this is something that I'll do on my pc.
I'll probably just use the Heroku CLI, and I already have it installed on that computer.
I can always update the application, but it's pretty much at a point where I wouldn't mind pushing it.
The code could be cleaner, but it's a first attempt, and the actual deployment of the application is part of the learning experience as well.
