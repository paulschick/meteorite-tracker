# Stop, Take a Look, Pull it All Together

Time to pull everything together.  

Go through the notes on the current app.
I have a good understanding of how this application works and was put together.
My explanation of everything thus far can be concise and come from a place of understanding.  

After dealing with these notes, and the beginning notes of the course application, I'll move onto the advanced concepts.
I'm not going to implement the filtering, sorting, and searching here yet.
I would like to go through the notes, and gain an internalized understanding before writing the code.  

Then I can implement. I don't just want to do another code-along with it.
