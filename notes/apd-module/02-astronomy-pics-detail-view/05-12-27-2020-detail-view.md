## Branch Name: 12-27-2020-development

Continuing dev

- Service set up
- Data stored in array in list component
- Create new route for individual image detail view -> display unused data from Observables  

## Todos

1. Create `astronomy-pic-detail.page.ts` in `astronomy-pics/pages` X
2. Create route to `astronomy-pic-detail.page.ts` in `astronomy-pics-routing.module.ts` and import to the module X
   1. **IMPORTANT** -> properly configure route to take in parameter `/:id`
3. Import `astronomy-pic-detail.page.ts` to `astronomy-pics.module.ts` and add to `declarations` array. X
4. Create `astronomy-pic-detail.component.ts`
   1. Create with CLI so the imports can be automatic, as well as creation of the html/scss main file
5. Import `astronomy-pic-detail.component.ts` into `astronomy-pics.module.ts`
6. Create the scss folder for the component  

All of the above completed

## Evening Development

- The images themselves should be links
- Have little to no text on the gallery page (What's the point of having a title or anything?)
  - Just make sure with no text that it is implied that these are clickable items.
    - Do so either with the way that they are presented on the page, with icons, or with some text direction at the top of the page
- Th gallery page should have basically just images  

First step though is to set up each of those images as just links to the detail page for that image.
So I've got to first understand the route paramaterization and so forth.
This will need access to the array of Observables as an `@Input()` property.  

### On Route Resolvers

I actually think that the astronomy-pics gallery page may benefit from *Not* using a resolver.
Rather than waiting for all of the images to load, having some of them load means that you are on the page, viewing images sooner than with a resolver.
The images that are still loading are down on the page where you have to physically scroll to see.
So, you really cannot tell that the page is not fully loaded.  

Here, I think that allowing partial loading is actually a feature, not a bug.
Be sure to descibe this rationale in the demonstration, and be ready to take feedback that may run contrary to this perspective.

### Route Parameterization

General Example:

```html
<a [routerLink]="['/products', product.id]">{{ product.productName }}</a>
```

So I'd like to do this with nothing in the route, as in it's a root route

```html
<a [routerLink]="['', astronomyPic.id]"><img ... /></a>
<!-- OR -->
<a [routerLink]="['/', astronomyPic.id]"><img ... /></a>
```

Either way, there's a method for making this work.
I think the second option with `'/'` is the correct option.
Give the id something to grab onto.

### Reading Route Parameters

**ActivatedRoute Service** is the way to get access to route parameters.
Provides an Observable, so need to subscribe to this in order to get access to the route paramaters.  

```ts
export class ExampleClass {

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {  }

  // snapshot option
  const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');

  // or, Observable option
  this.route.paramMap.subscribe(
    params => {
      const id = params.get('id');
    }
  );
}
```

I need to create a method that will take in an id as a number.
With that said, I need to assign an id to each of the items.
The `getImage` method will have to look at the array that was returned from the API call.
Since I'm saving this array, I shouldn't have to make another API call.  

Also those don't have IDs, I'll have to assign an id like, within the map function, or as the result of another function.
So, what I could do, is when subscribing to the Observable, when being saved to the array, which is also an Observable I think, pass that into another method which maps through and assigns an id.
Just give it index + 1.
Ids will just be 1-10, or whatever number of items in the array.  

- Added `id?:number;` as another part of the IApd interface.  

Running a `typeof` on the `astroPics` property returns `object` in the console, which tells me that it's actually an Observable.  

So it looks like the logic to add the ids needs to be done in the service, as I can't access the array as an observable outside of the `.subscribe()` method.  

Calling different methods on the service is not returning array-based things.
It's like always individual objects.  

Since I'm having issues with trying to add an id to an Observable, and I have a finite amount of time to figure this out, I'll just use the date as the id.
So I'll return the date, and this will be the id.  

So the parameter will be a string in the form of yyyy-mm-dd.
This is definitely easier at my level than adding an id to the observable, even though it might be actually simple to do.  

Alright, got it wired up and working.
Not using root, using `astronomy-pics/image/2020-12-26` as an example.  

When in doubt, just keep it simple.
The longer this kind of stuff takes, the less time I have for styling and cleaning it up.
That stuff will count more than the route parameter.
It's like painting a house, people notice certain things more than others.  

### Grab single Image

So now, I'll need to get a single image either from the API, or from the Observable.
The way it's set up now, I'll need to make another API call.
So, I need another function in the service that get's one image.
This is easy to do.  

This function will be called from the astronomy-pic-detail component when it loads.
It will use `ActivatedRoute` to grab the date from the url, and it will make an api call using that date.
So the date being the parameter is actually necessary to make the subsequent API call.
So it works out.  

For this, I'm going to just add this to the service.
