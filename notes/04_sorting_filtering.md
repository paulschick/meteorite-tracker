## Overview

This is the Big Boy.  

NOTE: no model for this one.
It's not worth figuring out how to apply that to the huge API response coming in.
Wait until I go through the Http in the course, then apply it in the future.

### Looking at the Steps

1. Create a reactive input form
   1. Input field
      1. Keep in mind -> this is a filter form, not a search form (different, same response from the API, just sorted/filtered)
   2. Submit button
2. Add sorting/filtering method to the meteorite.service.ts file  

Filtering and sorting is going to be quite a bit of work. So if I choose to udertake it, probably a few hours at least.
We're at 11pm... Might be better to go and get the notes nice and concise.
We'll deal with the sorting/filtering if there is time.
I would benefit from going through those notes.  

Everything else up until this point, I have and had a good enough understanding of.
The form stuff and the methods involved with them I do need to study more.
So I should study, go through the notes, make them concise, and show an understanding.
This is better than just copying the code, again, but applying it to meteors instead.
