## Testing a Pipe

*Either just take notes, or follow in the course repo*.  

We'll do pipe, service, component, then mocking and interaction testing.
So I'll be able to apply this to here soon enough.  

### Pipe Idea

I actually do need a custom pipe to format the meteorite mass from grams to kilograms.
This could actually be a quick build, and then I can test it.
