## Adding Responsiveness

Now, we'll bind to these properties so that we can do true property binding.
This is the whole point of Angular ðŸ˜Š.  

- Added public property `isScreenSmall` to sidenav component.
- Injected `BreakpointObserver` from angular/cdk/layout  

In ngOnInit(), just breakpointObserver

- Observe small width breakpoint, which was set as a variable of 720 outside of the class
- Subscribe to the BreakpointState, watch the size of the screen.
- When the state matches the break point state, then isScreenSmall as a boolean, will be true or false

## Creating a Toggle Button

The 'open sidenav' button is going to be moved to the toolbar.  

I would, additionally, like to be able to close the sidenav from the larger screen.
Additionally, I don't think I'll keep this being automatically open on a larger screen.  

Fixed already, changed the onClick from `sidenav.Open()` to `sidenav.Toggle()`.
I'm going to keep all of this code in an additional folder.
Good to have on hand.  

Originally, we have a click event in the button.
What we'll do is have a `toggleSidenav()` event in the toolbar, which will call `sidenav.toggle()`.
Effectively, this takes the place of the button below the toolbar that we have been using.  

### sidenav.component.html

1. Delete the button
2. Add event-binding toggleSidenav connected to sidenav.toggle()  
   1. toggleSidenav (child event)
   2. sidenav.toggle() -> parent response

### toolbar component

**html template**

1. Added button
2. event emitter -> click event, toggleSidenav.emit()  

**ts component file**  

1. Add Output property `toggleSidenav` as new EventEmitter  

***IMPORTANT*** this wouldn't initially compile because vs code with smart import, imported EventEmitter from 'Events' instead of @angular/core, where it is supposed to come from.
