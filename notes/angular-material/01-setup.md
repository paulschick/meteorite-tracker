# Angular Material

These go hand in hand. I'm watching the Angular Material Course, So I might as well check this out.
He'll go through things like sidenav, and they definitely have modals.  

So I'll have to remove Bootstrap, and uninstall it.  

Important, node modules will be changed, so should make a new dir as a clone.
