# Angular Material

These go hand in hand. I'm watching the Angular Material Course, So I might as well check this out.
He'll go through things like sidenav, and they definitely have modals.  

So I'll have to remove Bootstrap, and uninstall it.  

Important, node modules will be changed, so should make a new dir as a clone.

```ps1
ng add @angular/material
```

Options:

- Deep Purple / Amber
- Global Material Typography Styles -> y
- Browser animations for Angular Material -> y
  - This is the majority of Angular's animations
