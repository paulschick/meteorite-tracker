# Section 05 - Layout Component

- Flexbox overview first  

## Angular Flex Layout

- FlexBox CSS + mediaQuery
- This is a module for Angular
- Custom layout API  

I will add this to the application, might be helpful to use.  

```ps1
npm i -s @angular/flex-layout
```

Ran through the installation, was very quick.  

***I am importing & exporting this in the shared module***
