# Section 05 - Layout Component

- Flexbox overview first  

## Angular Flex Layout

- FlexBox CSS + mediaQuery
- This is a module for Angular
- Custom layout API  

I will add this to the application, might be helpful to use.  

```ps1
npm i -s @angular/flex-layout
```

Ran through the installation, was very quick.  

***I am importing & exporting this in the shared module***  

FlexLayoutModule was added to imports/exports of SharedModule.
I will need to learn how to use this in order to create layouts for the application.
Shouldn't be too difficult.

## Scaffolding the App

This is based on the course project.
May get some ideas from this.

## Sidenav and Toolbar

Created sidenav and toolbar components.
The router outlet is within the sidenav so that the sidenav opens into the page content.
Took some work, but the current setup is how this should be setup to work properly.
