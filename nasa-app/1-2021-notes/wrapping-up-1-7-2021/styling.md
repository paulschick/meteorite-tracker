## UI Design

I will follow some dark theme tutorials.
I want to wrap this up, no problem getting external inspiration.

The home page is great to get the styling done on, but this is a feature branch, so I don't have to have it.
What must be worked on is:

- random image page
- Home page header image layout
- Astronomy Pictures page -> play with the card styling
- Also deal with the non-jpg filetypes that come in through the api.
  - Don't dislay an empty image tag here.
