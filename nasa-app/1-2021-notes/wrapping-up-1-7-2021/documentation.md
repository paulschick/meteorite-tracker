# This is the Big One

- Document the process for building
- Show the logic that went into it
- Show what the problems are and the solution
- Show issues with the current design with potential solutions
- Have examples for the solutions/alternatives, even if not applied to this application
- Future dev  

Have a GitHub wiki if that makes sense (a README would get too big)
