# Reviewing My Meeting with Jay

We went through the project for a few hours. I got some great notes on what to improve.  

## TODO

- [x] Filter meteorites header removal - redundant headings
- [x] Create meteorite sort functionality (show, filter, sort)
- [x] Astro-pics should be 12 images not 10 - breakpoints divide into 12 better than 10
- [x] Random image detail page should be a unique route - not the route from astro-pics
- [x] Back button from random image detail should go back to random image view
- [ ] Delegate filtering and sorting logic to services (filter.service.ts, sort.service.ts) (*pending dependencies, not required*)
