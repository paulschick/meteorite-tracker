# Adding Charts and Stats About the Meteorites

The purpose is to add some more dynamic functionality, and an interesting feature about the meteorites.
This is a way to show some more skills that aren't explicitly in the learning path.
Additionally, this is another way to implement data manipulation, an Event But, and Container-Presentation Pattern.  

I have one day to finish the project, so I need to evaluate the payoff of this.
My hope is that I'll be demonstrating the use of a pipe in the place of where a function might be used, and also to communicate between components that aren't nested.
Namely, using an Event Bus to communicate.
Also, to have loosely coupled services, like the Modal and Modal Trigger service, as well as Material Tooltips.  

This could potentially show a good improvement in design from the original application to the addition of this new feature.
I should be able to add this feature without manipulating the meteorite source code.
That is another big point.
