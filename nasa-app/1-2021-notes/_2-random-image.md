# Back To The Random Images

1. Remove the route resolver from the random-image route
2. Create separate service to make the HTTP call for the random image
3. Replace the astro-pics service with the new service in this component
4. Write a test for this service if it's used by a component with no other dependencies, or write a test for the service itself
